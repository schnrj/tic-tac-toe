- Interactive and user-friendly design.

## How to Play

1. The game board is a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their marker (X or O) in an empty cell.
3. The first player to align three markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
