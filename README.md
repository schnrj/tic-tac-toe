# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses) game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Two-player mode: Players take turns to mark their symbol (X or O) on the grid.
- Win detection: Automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
- Interactive design with a clean and responsive interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. The game board is a 3x3 grid displayed on the webpage.
2. Players take turns to click on an empty cell to place their marker (X or O).
3. The first player to align three markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
4. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
